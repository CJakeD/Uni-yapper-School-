    CEBU - Cebu Technological University Danao-Campus boasts peerless recognition and enless supply of outstanding talents from every departments. From the logical minds of Computer Engineering Department, flawless precision of Civil Engineering Department, to the awe-inspiring talents of Hospitality Management Department, one can see talents everywhere in this university. But for today, let's delve deeper to the less talked topic when it comes to the university: Regulations.
    <br><br>
    In this special article from the Uni-Yapper, let us get to know the newest addition to the security system of the school, the infamous ID Scanner.

  <p class="meat">
    The main gate is what you will first see when entering the school premises. Not long ago, the school security guard would painstakingly check
    each student's ID in order to let them in. But now, due to the addition of ID Scanners, a lot of workload has been lifted for them.
      <br><br>
      However, some students occassionally get confused on how to operate it, resulting in a moderately long queue.

  <h3 class="food">STEP 2: SWIPE IT (lightly!)</h3>

  <p class="meat">
    A lot of students get confused and sometimes get stuck up during the scanning process. Some stick their ID on the scanner for a long
    time (which is a no-no!), some also get confused when to cross the metal bars once the scanning is complete.
    <br><br>
    The correct way would be: to swipe the ID on the scanner quickly and avoid lingering it for too long as this can confuse the scanner.
    Once it is scanned, an arrow would pop up on the LED display indicating the direction you intend to go. If it points the opposite way,
    you might've forgot to swipe previously or you might've done it incorrectly. Either way, swiping again would solve the problem. Once the arrow
    appears, the metal bars would shake lightly, indicating that it is now time for you to cross it.

  <p class="meat">
    Now, my dear readers, despite the detailed explanation on how to use the newest scanner in the school security system, if something arises
    and you are not too sure of it, feel free to call the attention of nearby security guards for guidance.
